# The Big 5

 * Making sense of people decoding and decoding the mysteries of personality.

The story of the big 5 is motivated from how Klein is able to highlight the main characteristics with only a handful of words. Was he intuitively asking himself a set of questions that are as obvious to him as the five Ws? Also can we learn a technique to make our own descriptions of people more incisive and complete?

To do this, the phychologists firstly built a thesasus composed of 1,000+ words using their domain knowledge. The words are then fed to ordinary people who were asked to apply each of these words by ranking their applicability to themselves or another person. **Factor analysis** was then applied to cluster the words into 5 domains, named *the Big Five*.

### The Big 5 Chart

The descriptive name of each of the domains should be 
 * **O**penness - The tendency to be imaginative and to enjoy novelty and variety
 * **C**onscientiousness - The tendency to control impulses and to tenaciously pursue goals
 * **E**xtraversion - The tendency to actively reach out to others
 * **A**greeableness - The tendency to be altruistic, cooperative, and good-natured
 * **N**euroticism - The tendency to have negative feelings, particularly in reaction to perceived social threats

Each of the domain are then divided into 6 facets.

### Putting People into Categories

Some evocate words carry extra emotional weight because they evoke images that are more vivid than the decisive ones. Recognizing the usefulness of such words, psychiatrists have created a vocabulary for the potentially troublesome personality patterns, namely, antisocial, avoidant, borderline, compulsive, dependent, histrionic, narcissistic, paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal.

The very low/high values of OCEAN lead to the ten patterns, separately. Those relations are illustrated in the rest of the chapter.

Taking a person's opionion of himself and her general opionion of others, it can be lumped into 4 categories. Two of them project positive self-images: "I'm Special" and "I'm right", and the other two are more negative: "I'm vulnerable" and "I'm detached". The ten patterns can be fitted into those categories, and it generates the feeling of herself and others in the opposite direction.

Thinking people in terms of both their traits and their patterns, it's possible to not only start seeing them more clearly, also become increasing aware of the great variety of human personalities.
